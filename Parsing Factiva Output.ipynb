    "This notebook will allow you to parse results files downloaded from *Factiva*.  Specifically, I searched for *Wall St. Journal* articles on ~300 North American companies -- one at a time. For each company, I then selected all found articles ('headline' results) and emailed myself the results in HTML format.  I then saved each attached file with the relevant stock ticker name; for instance, *AAPL.html* might contain 37 articles for Apple. This notebook is designed to loop over all and parse all the individual HTML files and convert the output to an Excel spreadsheet containing one row per article, with columns for date, source, company, article headline, and article body.\n",
